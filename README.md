# HLL_CRCON_Language_doorkeeper
A plugin for Hell Let Loose (HLL) CRCON (see : https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool)
that filters (kick) players based upon their language.

‚ö†Ô∏è This one has been developed for french communities.  
You'll have to do **a lot** of translation work to adapt it to your language.

üá™üá∏ A spanish-speaking user was kind enough to prepare an ES config (see below).

## Install

> [!NOTE]
> The shell commands given below assume your CRCON is installed in `/root/hll_rcon_tool`.  
> You may have installed your CRCON in a different folder.  
>   
> Some Ubuntu Linux distributions disable the `root` user and `/root` folder by default.  
> In these, your default user is `ubuntu`, using the `/home/ubuntu` folder.  
> You should then find your CRCON in `/home/ubuntu/hll_rcon_tool`.  
>   
> If so, you'll have to adapt the commands below accordingly.

- Log into your CRCON host machine using SSH and enter these commands (one line at at time) :  

  First part  
  If you already have installed any other "custom tools" from ElGuillermo, you can skip this part.  
  (though it's always a good idea to redownload the files, as they could have been updated)
  ```shell
  cd /root/hll_rcon_tool
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_restart/refs/heads/main/restart.sh
  mkdir custom_tools
  cd custom_tools
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_custom_common_functions.py/refs/heads/main/common_functions.py
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_custom_common_translations.py/refs/heads/main/common_translations.py
  ```
  Second part  
  ```shell
  cd /root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_Language_doorkeeper/refs/heads/main/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper.py
  ```
  Third part : template for üá´üá∑ french (FR) communities  
  ```shell
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_Language_doorkeeper/refs/heads/main/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config.py
  ```
  Third part : template for üá™üá∏ spanish (ES) communities  
  ```shell
  wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ElGuillermo/HLL_CRCON_Language_doorkeeper/refs/heads/main/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config_ES.py
  mv /root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config_ES.py /root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config.py
  ```

- Edit `/root/hll_rcon_tool/config/supervisord.conf` to add this bot section :  
  ```conf
  [program:language_doorkeeper]  
  command=python -m custom_tools.language_doorkeeper  
  environment=LOGGING_FILENAME=language_doorkeeper_%(ENV_SERVER_NUMBER)s.log  
  startretries=100  
  startsecs=10  
  autostart=true  
  autorestart=true  
  ```

## Config
- Edit `/root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config.py` and set the parameters to fit your needs.  
- Restart CRCON :  
  ```shell
  cd /root/hll_rcon_tool  
  sh ./restart.sh
  ```

## Limitations
‚ö†Ô∏è Any change to these files requires a CRCON rebuild and restart (using the `restart.sh` script) to be taken in account :  
- `/root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/common_functions.py`
- `/root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/common_translations.py`  
- `/root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper.py`  
- `/root/hll_rcon_tool/custom_tools/language_doorkeeper_config.py`

‚ö†Ô∏è This plugin requires a modification of the `/root/hll_rcon_tool/config/supervisord.conf` file, which originates from the official CRCON depot.  
If any CRCON upgrade implies updating this file, the usual upgrade procedure, as given in official CRCON instructions, will **FAIL**.  
To successfully upgrade your CRCON, you'll have to revert the changes back, then redo the mandatory changes for this plugin to work.  
To revert to the original file :  
```shell
cd /root/hll_rcon_tool
git restore config/supervisord.conf
```
