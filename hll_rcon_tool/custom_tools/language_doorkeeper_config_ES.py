"""
language_doorkeeper_config.py

A plugin for HLL CRCON (https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool)
that filters (kick) players based upon their language.

This version has been designed to be used on ES (spanish) servers.

Unfortunately, english servers can't really use it,
as many people in the world will understand the question and defeat the test.
