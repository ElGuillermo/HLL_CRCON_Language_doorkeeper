"""
language_doorkeeper_config.py

A plugin for HLL CRCON (https://github.com/MarechJ/hll_rcon_tool)
that filters (kick) players based upon their language.

It has been designed for french servers, you'll have to adapt it to your language.

Unfortunately, english servers can't really use it,
as many people in the world will understand the question and defeat the test.
